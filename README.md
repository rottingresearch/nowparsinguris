# Now Parsing URIs

The name isn't great, but PyPi has very few names left. This was an autofill from some release notes and it worked. So now we are "nowparsinguris".

The purpose of this project is to create a Python library that specifically validates URIs that pertain to the Rotting Research project and Linkrot. These will include but are not limited to :

- URL
- DOI
- ArXiv
- Perma.cc
- web.archive.org
